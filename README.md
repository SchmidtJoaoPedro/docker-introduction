## üê≥ Course Summary ‚Äì Introduction to Docker

**Summary**

During the **Introduction to Docker** course, I learned the core concepts of **containerization** and **application virtualization**.  
I understood how Docker simplifies the creation of isolated and portable environments, improving the way applications are developed, tested, and deployed.

I learned how to:
- Install and configure Docker on different operating systems;  
- Create and manage **containers** and **images**;  
- Use essential commands (`docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker build`, `docker-compose`, etc.);  
- Write custom **Dockerfiles** to automate image builds;  
- Work with **volumes**, **networks**, and **Docker Compose** to orchestrate multiple containers;  
- Build full applications with **frontend (Nginx)** and **backend (Flask/Python)**;  
- Publish and version images on repositories like **Docker Hub**.

By the end of the course, I was able to develop and run containerized projects, integrate multiple services, and understand Docker‚Äôs role in **DevOps** and **CI/CD** pipelines.
